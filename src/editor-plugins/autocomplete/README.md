# Autocomplete for Obsidian Editor

These components implement cursor-style autocomplete functionality intended for the main Obsidian editor, not the chat view.

## Components

- **AutocompletePlugin.tsx** - Handles the logic for generating completions and managing the autocomplete state
- **GhostText.tsx** - Renders the ghost text UI for showing completions

## Implementation Notes

To integrate these components with the Obsidian editor, you'll need to:

1. Create a CodeMirror extension or hook into Obsidian's editor events
2. Implement a mechanism to trigger completions based on user typing
3. Connect the completions to the editor's cursor position

This is a work in progress and these files are preserved for future implementation.
